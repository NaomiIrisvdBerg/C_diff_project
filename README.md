# Emergent metabolic interactions in resistance to Clostridioides difficile invasion. 
NOTE: ONGOING POLISHING

In this project, we aim to understand ecology and mechanisms driving the post-antibiotics C. difficile resistance of a synthetic gut bacterial community (Mix-14), found by the Joy Scaria Lab.
In this repository, you can find R scripts for:
A) Statistical analyses of wetlab data (and corresponding figures), 
B) Mathematical modelling of Mix-14 interaction dynamics. 

Dedicated branches contain respective scripts as well as input files (csv format).

Scripts were ran in RStudio (RStudio 2022.02.3+492 "Prairie Trillium" Release).
Package details and versions at time of running the scripts are detailed in respective Methods sections of the manuscript.
