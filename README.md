# C_diff_project
Understanding possible ecology and mechanisms driving the post-AB C. diff resistance of Mix14, by Scaria Lab
In this repository, you can find the main MATLAB (.m) script used to run the community simulations, as well as the script for automation of extraction of model performance metrics, both of which were run on the HPC. In both of these endeavours, I was helped by Lajos Kalmar (bioinformatician of the Tox Unit)
The main script attached is of network II.
